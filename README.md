# CTE-For-Monkeys

# Goal of Cyber Threat Emulation 
- The goal as a Cyber Threat Emulator is to provide training on how APTs act on a network by replicating their actions in a live environment, providing trainee with the ability to test their tools and techniques when it comes to network and host analysis.


# Goal of the CTE-For-Monkey

- This training serves as a crash course on how to quickly and effectively learn not a particular tool but rather focus on the methodology. In CTE/Red Space there are many ways to accomplish the same task, the goal here is to build that understanding and the foundation needed to think like a Threat Actor.
